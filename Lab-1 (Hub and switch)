Aim: To create topology and simulate a single PDU from source to destination using a hub and a switch as connecting devices.

Topology: refer Diagram

Procedure:
1) Create a generic hub and switch.
2) Add Generic PC's, connect 4 to hub, 4 to switch.
3) Connect them using copper straight cables.
4) Place notes with the IP addresses assigned


Observations:
A) Learning:
1) Hub sends information to all connected devices, Switch sends information to the specific device.
2) In a hub, Before adding a new device, first we need to check if ports are available. If no ports are available, then turn off the device first and drag and drop ports.
4) In a generic hub, a maximum number of 10 devices.
5) Switch has one console and 6 fast ethernet connections. No option of adding an extra port.
 

B) Results:
1) In realtime mode,
for Hub:

PC>ping 10.0.0.2 (input)
Pinging 10.0.0.2 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 10.0.0.2: bytes=32 time=10ms TTL=128
Reply from 10.0.0.2: bytes=32 time=4ms TTL=128
Reply from 10.0.0.2: bytes=32 time=4ms TTL=128
Reply from 10.0.0.2: bytes=32 time=4ms TTL=128
Ping statistics for 10.0.0.2:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 4ms, Maximum = 10ms, Average = 5ms


for Switch:

Ping statistics for 10.0.0.71:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms

2) In simulation mode,
  for Hub:
 a simple PDU sent from a source is sent to the Hub and from there it is sent to all the nodes.

for Switch:
a simple PDU is sent from source to switch and from there to the specific device.
